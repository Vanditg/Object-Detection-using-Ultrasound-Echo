# Object-Detection-using-Ultrasound-Echo
We used the HCSR-04 Ultrasonic module to trigger the ultrasound. The echo which was detected depends on the distance traveled by the ultrasound wave. By measuring the pulse width of the echo and after applying mathematical formulations, the distance between the object and the module can be determined. This was done using the Arduino Mega board which uses AVR ATmega2560 as the controller.
